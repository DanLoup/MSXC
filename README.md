# MSXC
For now it is just a not very compatible MSX 1 & 2 emulator, but the idea is to make it very tinkerable as the MSX platform itself is a very flexible and fun one.

# Usage
You will need to provide the bios folder with the MSX BIOS files used by FMSX and run the software.
To go back to the menu while the emulator is running, use F6.
